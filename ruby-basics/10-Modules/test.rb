# A module is like a class but, unlike classes, you cannot create objects from modules.
# Classes cannot inherit from modules. 
# If a class wants to use the code in a module it has to include or 'mix in' that module. 
# This makes it possible for a class to incorporate the features of multiple modules in a way that is a bit like 'multiple inheritance' â€“ so even though a class can only have a single ancestor
