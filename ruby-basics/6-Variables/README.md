# Types of variables
## Local variables
A local variable name always starts with a lowercase letter(a-z) or underscore (_). Local variables are not available outside the method. There is no need to initialize the local variables.

```
age = 10
_Age = 20
```

## Instance variables
An instance variable name always starts with a @ sign. They are similar to Class variables but their values are local to specific instances of an object. Instance variables are available across methods for any specified instance or object. No need to initialize the instance variables.

## Class variables
## Global variables
